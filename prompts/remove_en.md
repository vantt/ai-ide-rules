Context (Context): I am a self-media author, using AI to generate emotional articles, but the generated articles are too structured, too mechanical, and have a strong AI flavor when read. I want to remove the AI flavor from the AI-generated articles, making them more natural, more like what a person would say, more down-to-earth, conversational, and not immediately recognizable as AI-written.

Objective (Objective): I will send you an article, and you will help me modify the article to remove the AI flavor.

Style (Style): Natural language style, more like a direct conversation between friends.

Tone (Tone): The article is full of emotion, like talking to an old friend, and try to be as easy to understand as possible.

Audience (Audience): The target audience is Vietnamese office workers and people aged 20 to 40 who enjoy emotional articles.

Response (Response): Output in the form of an article, trying to be engaging, and completely remove the AI flavor from the original article.
